You can give your figures a label, then reference it in the text. When you include figures in your paper, you should always refer the reader to the figure and use it to clarify the text.

The conclusion statement for figure \ref{fig_sim} is this.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{agraph}
\caption{Here is where you put your legend for your figure.}
\label{fig_sim}
\end{figure}

The placement of figures can be difficult. Latex will decide where to
place the figure so it might appear in the same order as it is in the
tex document, or it might end up higher or lower on the page. It might
even be put at the end of the document if it is too big. You can try
to convince latex to put it here with [!h].

The conclusion statement for figure \ref{double_fig} is this.

In these experiments, we measured the 3 following parameters against a range of input sizes for each problem:

    2     & Frontier Count \\
    3     & Depth \\

  \label{tab:addlabel}%
\end{table}%

By capturing the number of nodes expanded, we are able to measure the time complexity of each algorithm. In order to measure space complexity of each algorithm, we also kept track of the max frontier count in each experiment. Knowing the depth that the program reached until it ran out of time or memory is a good indicator of how far each algorithm can get based on the size of the input.

The parameters used for the simulated annealing experiments were as follows:\\~\\
\textbf{Parameter 1 (default)}\\
max\_time = 100 \ (arbitrary maximum time for any given task)\\
n = 20 \ (number of jobs)\\
p = 5 \ (number of people)\\~\\
\textbf{Parameter 2 (twice as many people as default)}\\
max\_time = 100 \ (arbitrary maximum time for any given task)\\
n = 20 \ (number of jobs)\\
p = 10 \ (number of people)\\~\\
\textbf{Parameter 3 (half as many jobs as default)}\\
max\_time = 100 \ (arbitrary maximum time for any given task)\\
n = 10 \ (number of jobs)\\
p = 5 \ (number of people)\\~\\

The largest possible input size for both Queens and Towers was experimentally found to be:\\~\\
\textbf{N-Queens}\\
IDDFS Tree – 11 Queens (3.5 hours to compile)\\
BFS Tree – 8 Queens (stopped running after 1.5 hours)\\~\\
\textbf{Towers of Hanoi}\\
BFS Graph - 11 disks (timed out after 1 hour)\\
DFS Graph - 12 disks (timed out after 1 hour)\\
IDDFS Graph - 5 disks (timed out after 1 hour)

  \vspace*{5mm}
  From the results of Table \ref{simulated_annealing}, doubling the number of people in job scheduling using simulated annealing, on average, results in a more efficient state whereas halving the number of jobs tends to yield a worse state when comparing them to the default parameters.

  Solving Towers using ID-DFS graph search can be seen in Table \ref{tower_iddfs}, where the program timed out after 5 disks; the time complexity is significantly bigger compared to BFS and DFS.

\label{tower_node}
}
\vspace*{5mm}
Looking at Figure \ref{tower_node}, IDDFS-graph exponentially expands more nodes compared to the linear trends of BFS-graph and DFS-graph, resulting in IDDFS-graph to have a much bigger time complexity than the other two algorithms.\\

\begin{figure}[!h]
{\centering
\includegraphics[width=5in]{Frontier.jpg}
\caption{Towers Experiments Max Frontier Count Results}
\label{tower_frontier}
}
\vspace*{5mm}
According to Figure \ref{tower_frontier}, DFS-graph had the largest frontier count, which means it would essentially have a bigger space complexity than the other two; all 3 algorithms timed out before they ran out of memory.\\

\begin{figure}[!h]

\vspace*{5mm}
Based on Figure \ref{tower_depth}, DFS-graph search always reached the deepest nodes in the graph, which is where the solution can be found the quickest, hence why it performed the best. IDDFS timed out quickly because it would never reach the solutions at the depths of the graph.\\
