#### Code Base for CSCI4511

Algorithms (e.g. BFS, A*, CSP, etc.) and Problems (e.g. NQueens, Sudoku, Towers of Hanoi) will be added here as the semester progresses. Some code will be complete but require modification according to the homework requirements. Other code will not work until you fix it.

Problems can be solved with a specific algorithm by creating an instance of the problem and an instance of the algorithm.  For example:
```
problem = NQueens(4)
algorithm = BFS()
algorithm.solve(problem)
```
A test run of using BFS to solve 4-Queens has been set up in execute.py.

**_NOTE: We expect that all algorithms and problems follow the pattern of these samples. We expect that we can pass any problem to any algorithm, as given, without modification._**

If you have a bug to report, inform teaching staff. If you have a bug fix, you can submit a pull request. If you have a suggestion on how to make the code more efficient or user-friendly, please discuss with Dr. Larson.
