#### Code Base for CSCI4511

The code base has been expanded. The previous versions of most of these files are the same as in the last assignment. However, it would be best to create a new directory for this new assignment to be sure you have the latest updates.

Of course this is not the way to use Github, but the use of it for academic purposes goes against its intended use of shared development and open source.

If you have a bug to report, inform teaching staff. If you have a bug fix, you can submit a pull request. If you have a suggestion on how to make the code more efficient or user-friendly, please discuss with Dr. Larson.
